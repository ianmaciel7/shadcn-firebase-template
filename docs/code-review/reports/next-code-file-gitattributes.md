# Individual configuration and provenance review — `next-code-file-gitattributes`

## Identification

- **Review identity:** `next-code-file-gitattributes`
- **Primary file:** `.gitattributes`
- **Item type:** CODE_FILE
- **Inspected source revision:** `d2ac7d0390150b41509046ab2ead5e70c9ae9c66`
- **Framework reference:** Next.js 16.4.2 and React 19.3.1
- **Status:** Completed following successful branch review validation.

## Source evidence

Git normalizes source text to LF and assigns a custom merge driver to the tracked Graphify JSON artifact.

## Finding and limitations

The custom merge driver depends on developer machine configuration. This attribute file does not install that driver for other contributors.

No additional confirmed defect is claimed solely from this inspection. External service behavior, supply chain alerts and unrelated runtime components are outside this individual file's scope.

## Validation

The current file was inspected from the branch source and compared with its declared responsibility. The independent branch workflow passed inventory integrity, Biome, TypeScript, regressions, English, spelling and Markdown in [run 40234107521](https://github.com/ianmaciel7/shadcn-firebase-template/actions/runs/40234107521). Existence of a source index is not evidence of a new upstream verification.

## Disposition

Individual source review recorded. Preserve the limitations above when updating aggregate coverage.
